We are planning to remake Air Patriots, a game that can be downloaded for phones. There are two sides, the user side with the planes and the AI side with the balloons. The AI is very similar to Tower Defense as in it moves in a specific path. The objective of the game is to stop the balloons from getting from one side of the map to the other. The balloons will be able to shoot at the planes (they are air balloons with people in them) and the planes health will decrease. We are planning on having 3 different types of planes and 3 different types of balloons. The different balloons will have different frequencies of shooting and different health, as well as a different color so the user can see which types of balloons there are. Each plane will have a specific strength so the user can use it and plan to his advantage. One plane will have good shooting power, another will have good speed, and the last will have a lot of health. The user can have as many planes of each type he wants on the screen. However by killing the balloons, he collects money which he can use to buy the plane. There will be different maps (working towards having 3) and each one will have a different path for the balloons. Each of the maps will be survival mode trying to stay in the game the longest. The user can lose by either of the two ways: all his planes die (health is 0) or more than 20 balloons get to the other side of the map. The user will be able to control the path of his plane, and he can set the paths in game. If there is no path, the plane will keep heading in the same direction. We are planning to turn the plane around when it reaches the edges, but to make the game more interesting we might just have the plane die when it goes off the screen. Please see Air Patriots on Android Market to see how the game looks.
